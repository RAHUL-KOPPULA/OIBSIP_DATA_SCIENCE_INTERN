# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification Using Machine Learning

## Overview  
The Iris dataset is a classic in machine learning. It contains measurements of iris flowers belonging to three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. This project involves training a classification model to identify the species based on these measurements.

## Problem Statement  
Given the features like petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width, classify iris flowers into their correct species.

## Objectives  
- Understand and preprocess the Iris dataset  
- Train classification models to classify iris species  
- Evaluate model accuracy and performance

## Data  
You can use the built-in Iris dataset from Scikit-learn or download it from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).

## Methodology  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions  
- Model training using algorithms like Random Forest and Logistic Regression  
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix

## Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn

## Results  
- Achieved high classification accuracy (~95%+)  
- Gained insights into feature importance for species differentiation

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `iris_classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
