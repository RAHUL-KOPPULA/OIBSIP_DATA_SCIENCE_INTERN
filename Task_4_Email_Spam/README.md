# ðŸ“§ Email Spam Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview  
Spam emails are a major nuisance and a cybersecurity threat. This project builds a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or non-spam using text data and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Problem Statement  
Automatically filtering spam is crucial to protect users from scams and phishing attacks.

## Objectives  
- Preprocess raw email text data  
- Extract meaningful features using TF-IDF vectorization  
- Train and evaluate classification models such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression

## Data  
Dataset includes labeled emails categorized as spam or ham.

## Methodology  
- Text preprocessing: tokenization, stop word removal  
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF  
- Model training and testing  
- Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score

## Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLP libraries

## Results  
- Naive Bayes achieved ~95% accuracy  
- Effective spam filtering demonstrated

## How to Run  
1. Clone repo  
2. Run `spam_detection.ipynb` notebook
