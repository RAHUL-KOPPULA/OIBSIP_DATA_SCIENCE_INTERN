# ðŸ“Š Unemployment Rate Analysis During COVID-19

## Overview  
The COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented shock to the global economy, with unemployment rates soaring worldwide. This project analyzes how unemployment evolved during the pandemic, identifies key trends and factors influencing these changes, and applies machine learning models to forecast future unemployment rates.

## Problem Statement  
Unemployment rate is the percentage of unemployed people within the labor force. During COVID-19, understanding these shifts can help policymakers and economists design better recovery plans.

## Objectives  
- Explore the trend of unemployment rates before, during, and after COVID-19 outbreaks.  
- Identify demographic and sector-wise impact.  
- Build predictive models to forecast unemployment trends.

## Data  
Data sourced from trusted public datasets such as the World Bank and national labor statistics agencies.

## Methodology  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with time series plots  
- Feature engineering based on demographic and temporal factors  
- Random Forest Regression for forecasting

## Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results  
- Visualized sharp increases and gradual recovery in unemployment rates  
- Model achieved good forecasting accuracy with Random Forest Regression
