# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview  
Predicting the price of a car based on its features is a valuable application of machine learning that benefits consumers, dealers, and manufacturers alike. This project focuses on building regression models to accurately estimate car prices using key features such as brand goodwill, horsepower, mileage, and others.

## Problem Statement  
Car pricing depends on multiple factors. An automated prediction model helps buyers make informed decisions and businesses set competitive pricing.

## Objectives  
- Analyze factors influencing car prices  
- Develop regression models to predict prices  
- Evaluate models using performance metrics

## Data  
Dataset contains various car features collected from reliable sources.

## Methodology  
- Data cleaning and feature engineering  
- Exploratory analysis of feature impact on price  
- Model training using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor  
- Model evaluation using RÂ² score and RMSE

## Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn

## Results  
- Random Forest Regressor outperformed Linear Regression with higher accuracy  
- Model helps estimate prices based on user input features

## How to Run
